# GaP — Graph-as-Policy

:::{admonition} 🧪 GaP Beta Code release (1 July 2026)
:class: important

**GaP is under active development and now in beta testing.** Please send
comments and suggestions to [kych@berkeley.edu](mailto:kych@berkeley.edu) — we
plan to release an updated version by **1 Aug 2026**. Expect rough edges: APIs,
the workflow schema, and skill interfaces may change without notice between
releases.
:::

**The graph is the policy.** GaP is a multi-agent coding harness that compiles
a natural-language task into a typed, verified computation graph of modular
skills, self-improves it in simulation, and runs the graph — not a black-box
policy — on simulators and real robots. It targets **Variational Automation
(VA)**: tasks a robot must perform *persistently and reliably across many
varying instances* (objects vary in geometry and pose), not just solve once.

*Real-robot rollouts of graphs generated from one-sentence task descriptions.*

The [Overview](../getting-started/overview.md) has the full story — what
Variational Automation is, why the policy is a graph, and what you need to
run GaP.

## Hello world — your first run

The fastest path is the **[15-minute tour](../getting-started/quickstart.md)**:
clone the two repos side by side, sync, install the skill bundles, set one LLM
key, and run the hero LIBERO graph end-to-end with the trace open.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/graph-robots/graph-as-policy.git
git clone https://github.com/graph-robots/open-robot-skills.git   # sibling, auto-discovered
cd graph-as-policy
uv sync                                   # engine + LIBERO sim
uv run gap skills install --all           # per-bundle venvs (sam3, cuRobo, vlm, …)
export HF_TOKEN=...                        # gated SAM3 weights
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...             # codegen + in-graph VLM (openrouter is the default)
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run gap run examples/libero_quickstart/graph --sim libero_object_all_variance/0
uv run gap viz                            # browse the trial at localhost:9432
```
