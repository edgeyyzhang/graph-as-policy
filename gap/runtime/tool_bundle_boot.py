"""Discover which RPC-protocol tool bundles a workflow needs and boot them.

Parallel to :mod:`gap.runtime.policy_boot`. We discover the bundle set
from two sources:

1. Direct ``tool:`` nodes in the workflow (e.g. a node with
   ``tool: "sam3.segment"`` → the ``sam3`` bundle).
2. The ``allowed_tools`` list of every skill subgraph the workflow uses.
   Script nodes call tools via ``ctx.tool_call(...)``, not as workflow
   nodes — so a workflow's `target_sg` subgraph referencing a
   ``perceiving-objects`` skill must pre-boot every bundle that
   skill's ``allowed_tools`` declares (sam3, grounding-dino, vlm, …).

A bundle whose SKILL.md declares ``gap.serving.protocol == "stdio-msgpack"``
is booted out-of-process via :class:`ToolBundleManager`. Bundles without a
``gap.serving:`` block (or with ``in-process`` protocol) are unaffected:
their @tool registrations land in the registry via the in-process path
exactly as today.
