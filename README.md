# Graph-as-Policy
<h3 align="center">
  <strong>🧪 BETA CODE RELEASE</strong> | <em>Beta</em> | July 1, 2026
</h3>



**The graph is the policy.**
GaP targets *Variational Automation* — tasks a robot must perform persistently
and reliably across many varying instances (objects vary in geometry and pose),
not just solve once. It compiles a natural-language task into a typed, verified
computation graph of modular skills, self-improves it in simulation, and runs
the graph — not a black-box policy — on simulators and real robots.

tasks, refined in sim, executed on hardware. Left→right: grocery packing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🧪 GaP Beta Code release (1 July 2026).** GaP is under active development
> and now in beta testing. Please send comments and suggestions to
> <kych@berkeley.edu> — we plan to release an updated version by **1 Aug 2026**.
> Expect rough edges: APIs, the workflow schema, and skill interfaces may change
> without notice between releases.

```python
import gap

conn   = gap.connector.sim("libero", task="libero_object/0")
result = gap.execute("examples/libero_quickstart/graph", conn)
graph  = gap.agent.generate_sync("pick the soup can and put it in the basket")
print(graph)                  # the policy, as a graph
gap.viz.serve("outputs")      # browse the recorded trial
```

Skills live in the sibling
[**open-robot-skills**](https://github.com/graph-robots/open-robot-skills)
repo (Anthropic Agent Skills format, contributable) and are discovered
by path — clone the two repos side by side and every command finds them.

## Quickstart

**Requirements:** **1× NVIDIA RTX 4090 (≥24 GB VRAM, Linux + EGL)**, an
LLM API key (OpenRouter / Vertex), and
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). First run downloads ~3.5 GB of model
weights; the gated SAM3 weights are part of the default perception path,
so in practice you also need `HF_TOKEN` (a free
[HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with SAM3
access) before the first run.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/graph-robots/graph-as-policy.git
#   ^ submodules are required (vendored sim stack) — if you already cloned
#     plain, run: git submodule update --init --recursive
git clone https://github.com/graph-robots/open-robot-skills.git    # sibling, auto-discovered
cd graph-as-policy
uv sync                                  # engine + LIBERO sim (now baseline)
# `uv sync --extra vertex` instead if you'll use --provider vertex for codegen
uv run gap skills install --all          # per-bundle venvs (sam3, cuRobo, vlm, …)
#   --all includes the heavyweight learned-policy bundles; for one example,
#   `gap skills install --workflow <graph-dir>` installs just what it uses

export HF_TOKEN=...                      # for the gated SAM3 weights
uv run gap skills check --download       # weight prefetch (SAM3 + GDINO) + capability gate

# Pick one LLM provider for codegen + the in-graph VLM. openrouter is the
# default; for vertex, see `docs/source/authoring/llm-providers.md`.
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run gap run examples/libero_quickstart/graph \
  --sim libero_object_all_variance/0
uv run gap viz                           # browse the trial at localhost:9432
```

## Use with Claude Code & AI agents

GaP ships an agent skill ([`agent/`](agent/)) that teaches AI coding
agents the workflows above:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add graph-robots/graph-as-policy
claude plugin install gap@gap
```

Then ask: *"what can this robot do right now?"*, *"run the quickstart graph
in sim"*, *"generate a graph that packs the groceries"*, *"why did this
trial fail?"*. Real-robot commands are gated on explicit human
confirmation. Other agents (Cursor, Codex, …) and the no-install path:
[agent/INSTALL.md](agent/INSTALL.md).
