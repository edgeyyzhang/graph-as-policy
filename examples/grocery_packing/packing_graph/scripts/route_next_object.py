"""Loop control for grocery_packing's perceive_next subgraph.

Termination is UNPRIVILEGED and layered, matching the canonical
``perceiving-next-item`` skill (and the public grocery-packing benchmark's
graph) — the same policy runs unchanged on a real robot:

  1. **VLM completion check (primary).** Every pass, the exterior
     (agentview) frame goes to the VLM: "have ALL the grocery items been
     placed inside the basket?". A confident YES exits the loop cleanly on
     "none" (success). The check only ever forces a STOP — a NO or an
     unavailable VLM never forces the loop to continue, so the guards below
     still guarantee termination.
  2. **Env verdict (secondary, sim-only).** ``sim.check_success`` is polled
     as a backstop; ``task_completed`` reads the cached success the env
     computed in its own ``step()`` (see ``FrankaLiberoEnv.task_completed``),
     never re-evaluating the stateful ``pack_all_into`` predicate (which
     teleports delivered objects on each evaluation). Wrapped so non-sim
     connectors fall through cleanly.
  3. **No-progress guard.** If the SAME perceived target (cloud centroid
     within ``_SAME_TARGET_M``) comes back ``_STUCK_LIMIT`` consecutive
     passes, the loop cannot make progress on it -> "none" rather than
     re-grasping forever. A total-pass budget backstops alternation. State
     is keyed by the workflow's trace dir (unique per trial/run) so
     benchmark workers never leak one trial's state into the next.
  4. **Perception.** Otherwise route on the perceive verdict: "found" when
     an item was returned, "none" when nothing was.

We do NOT geometrically reject items near the basket (a real item beside the
basket falls inside any reasonable radius and was being dropped); the perceive
node's ``object_description`` keeps the tournament from picking the basket
while a real item remains. ``container_obb`` is still accepted (the subgraph
wires it in) but unused. Authored by build_graph.py.
